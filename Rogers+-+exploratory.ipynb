    " \" Right. All right. Now I hear what you are sayin’. Then all right, then I want to work on  -- I wanna work on accepting me, then. I want to work on feeling all right about it. But that makes sense. That that will come natural and then I won't have to worry about Pammy.  But when things do seem so wrong for me and I have an impulse to do them, how can I accept that?\",\n",
    " ' Right. And I feel like, I feel like…',\n",
    " ' Yeah, I feel like you are going to say, \"Now why do you think they’re wrong?\" and uh, I have mixed feelings there too.  Through therapy I will say, \"Now look, I know this is natural. Women feel it - sure, we don\\'t talk about it lots socially but all women feel it and it\\'s very natural.\" I have had sex for the last 11 years and I’m- of course going to want it, but I still think it is wrong unless you’re really, truly\\nin love with a man, and my body doesn\\'t seem to agree. And so I don\\'t know how to accept it.',\n",
    " ' Right. Well, I have a hopeless feeling.  I mean, these are all the things that I sort of feel myself, and I feel uh - O.K., now what?',\n",
    " \" Right. I uh- I really know you can't answer for me, and I have to figure it out myself, but I want you to guide me or show me where to start or - so it won't look so hopeless. I know I can keep living with this conflict and I know eventually things would work out, but I'd like feeling more comfortable with the way I live – and I'm not.\",\n",
    " ' I wish you would say to me to be honest and take the risk that Pammy’s going to accept me. And I also have a feeling if I could really risk it with Pammy, of all people, that I\\'d be able to say, \"Here\\'s this little kid that can accept me, and I\\'m really not that bad.\" If she really knows what a demon I am and still loves me and accepts me, it seems like it would help me to accept me more - like it\\'s really not that bad.  I want you to say to go ahead and be honest, but I don\\'t want the responsibility that it would upset her.  That is where I don\\'t want to take responsibility.',\n",
    " \" Yes. Like I wonder if my mother had been more open with me, maybe I wouldn't have had such a narrow attitude about sex. If I would have thought that she could be, you know, pretty sexy and ornery, and devilish too, that I wouldn't look at her as being such a sweet mother, that she could also be the other side. But she didn't talk about that. Maybe that's where I got my picture. I don't know, but I want Pammy to see me as a full woman, but also accept me.\",\n",
    " \" I don't? What do you mean?\",\n",
    " \" I would, but I don't want to quite take the risk of doing it unless an authority tells me that …\",\n",
    " \" Yeah. But then if I don't take the chance, if I feel loved and accepted by her, I'll never feel good about it anyway.\",\n",
    " \" Yeah, that’s what I mean, yes. But I also feel there is a lot of responsibility with being a mother. With I don’t- I don't want to feel like I have caused any big traumas in the children. I don't like all that responsibility. I think that's it. I don't like it, feeling it could be my fault.\",\n",
    " ' It is.',\n",
    " \" And you know, I- I look at it two ways. I like to see myself as being so honest with the kids, and really being proud of myself so that no matter what I told them or no matter how bad they think I was, I was honest and down deep it’s gonna be a much more wholesome relationship, and yet you know, I get jealous of like when they are with their daddy. I feel he’s more flip, he’s not quite as real, he’s not quite as honest, but nevertheless, they see a sweet picture of their dad. You know, he is all goodness and light, and I am envious of that too. I want them to see me just as sweet as they see him and yet I know he is not quite as real with them. So it seems like I've got to swap the one for the other, and I know\\nthis is really what I want the most, but uh, I miss some of that glory.\",\n",
    " \" But that’s close. That is what I mean. So uh- But I know she can't have that neat a picture of me, if I were honest. Besides that, I do feel that. I’m a little more ornery than their dad anyway. So I'm likely to do more things that they’d disapprove of.\",\n",
    " \" That's right. You know that's exactly it. Before therapy, I would have definitely chosen the other area. I’m going to get respect from them no matter what - even if I have to lie.\",\n",
    " \" But right now, I know that's not true  and I'm not positive they'll truly accept me. Something tells me they will. I know they will, but I am not positive. I want reassurance. I keep wanting these things.\",\n",
    " \" Yes. Yes. That's why I get encouraged when I read in a book from somebody I respect and admire, that this is the right thing no matter what - honesty will win out. Well then, that keeps giving me confidence. “By gosh, I'm right.” But I ...\",\n",
    " \" Which makes me feel rea- very immature. I don't like this in me. I wish I were grown up enough or mature enough to make my decisions and stick by them, but I need somebody to help me on - somebody to push me.\",\n",
    " ' Right. Right. And take more risks. I wish I’d take more risks. I wish that I could just go ahead and be this and say, however the children grow up, I\\'ve done my best. I didn’t have to constantly have this conflict. And I\\'d like, in later years, to say, \"No matter what you asked me kids, at least I told you the truth. You may not have liked it, but it\\'s been the truth.\" That, somehow, I can admire.  I- I disrespect people that lie. I hate it so, you see what a double bind I am in. I hate myself if I\\'m bad, but I also hate myself if I lie. So uh, it\\'s accepting. I want to become more accepting.',\n",
    " \" I do. I do because this has really bothered me. This happened with Pammy about a month ago and it keeps coming to my mind. I don't know whether to go back and talk to her about it or wait. She may have even forgotten what she asked me, but uh– it just\",\n",
    " ' I haven... No, I haven\\'t. And I would like, at least, to be able to tell her that I remember lying and I am sorry I lied and it has been driving me bugs because I did. I do- Now I feel like - now that\\'s solved - and I didn\\'t even solve a thing, but I feel relieved.  I uh- I do feel like you have been saying to me – you’re not say- giving me advice, but I do feel like you are saying, \"You really wanna- You know what pattern you want to follow Gloria, and go ahead and follow it.\" I sort of feel a backing up from you.',\n",
    " ' Are you telling me...',\n",
    " \" But then there's also a conflict there because I am not really positive what I wanna do. The lying part, yes, but I am not positive what I wanna do when I go against myself.  Like when I bring a man to the house. I am not sure I want to do that. If I feel guilty afterward, I must not have really wanted to.\",\n",
    " ' Yes. You know, this is so different. Now this kind of thing we are talking about now, it isn\\'t just knowing whether you want to do something or not. If I want to go to work in the morning or if I don\\'t want to go to work, that\\'s easy. But when I find myself doing something I don\\'t feel comfortable with, I automatically say, \"If you’re not comfortable Gloria, it’s not right. Something’s wrong.\" All right now. What I want to ask you is, how can I know which is the strongest? Because I do it, does that mean that’s the strongest? And yet, if I disapproved, that\\'s just part of the thing that’s got to go along with it? You see, it sounds like you... I\\'m picking up a contradiction. I’m not under- I’m not following.',\n",
    " \" Yes, and I have at times, when I’ve made a decision. Now that seems right. That seems perfectly right - no conflict - but then there are times I do things that I feel uncomfortable with. So that there is a conflict there.  It's not the same at all. So, what I'm saying is, how do I really know when I am following my true feelings, if I have conflicts afterwards or guilt afterwards?\",\n",
    " ' Yes. Like if I’m starting to do it -- O.K.',\n",
    " \" You know, the most outstanding thing - I don't know if you are following me, when I say about this conflict - the one thing I know is I’ve wanted, for example, to leave my husband for quite a few years. I never did it. I kept thinking how nice it would be, or how scary it would be, but I never did it. And all of a sudden when I did, it felt right. I didn't feel mean toward him. I just knew this was what I had to do. That's when I know I am following myself. I am following my feelings completely. I have no conflict there. Some unhappy things came from it , but I still have\\nno conflict. That, to me, is when I am following my feelings. And in everyday life the small little decisions, the small little things to do don't come out that clear at all. So many conflicts come with them.  Is this natural? \",\n",
    " \" I do. I do. And I miss that feeling other times. And it's right away a clue to me.\",\n",
    " ' But yet, many times I will go along and do it anyway. And say, \"Oh well, I\\'m in the situation now, I\\'ll just remember next time.\" I mentioned this word a lot in therapy and most therapists grin at me or giggle or something when I say \"utopia,\" but when I do follow a feeling and I feel this good feeling inside of me, that\\'s sort of utopia. That\\'s what I mean. That\\'s the way I like to feel whether it\\'s a bad thing or a good\\nthing. But I feel right about me. This is what I wanna…',\n",
    " \" Yes. Yeah, it gives me a choked up feeling when you say that because I don't get that as often as I'd like.  I like that whole feeling. That's real precious to me.\",\n",
    " ' Yeah, and you know what else I was just thinking? I – I feel dumb saying it uh - that all of a sudden while I was talking to you I thought, \"Gee, how nice I can talk to you and I want you to approve of me and I respect you, but I miss that my father couldn\\'t talk to me like you are.\" I mean, I\\'d like to say, \"Gee, I\\'d like you for my father.\"  I don\\'t even know why that came to me.',\n",
    " \" Yeah, I couldn't be open, but I, I wanna blame it on him. I think I’m more open than he'd allow me. He would never listen to me talk like you are and not disapprove, not lower me down. I thought of this the other day. Why do I always have to be so perfect? I know why. He always wanted me to be perfect. I always had to be better and uh... yeah, I miss that.\",\n",
    " ' Yet at the same time, rebelling.',\n",
    " ' Like I almost gloated writing him a letter the other day and telling him I am a waitress, which I expect him to disapprove of. I go out at nights and I almost gloated hitting him back - like, \"Now how do you like me?\"  And yet, I really want acceptance and love from him. I mean, I know he loves me.',\n",
    " ' Yeah.  \"You raised me, how do you like it?\" But do you know what I want him to say? \"I knew this was you all along, honey, and I really love\\nyou.\"',\n",
    " ' No. He won\\'t. He doesn\\'t hear. I went back home to him about two years ago, really wanting to let him know I loved him although I’ve been afraid of him. And he doesn\\'t hear me. He just keeps saying things like, \"Honey, you know I love you. You know I have always loved you.\" He doesn\\'t\\nhear. ',\n",
    " \" I don't know what it is. You know, when I talk about it, it feels more flip. If I just sit still a minute, it feels like a great big hurt down there. That I uh, feel cheated.\",\n",
    " \" Mhm. And again, that's a hopeless situation. I tried working on it, and uh, I feel it's something I have to accept. My father just isn't the type of man I'd really like. I'd like somebody more understanding and caring. He cares, but not in the way that we can cooperate or communicate.\",\n",
    " ' Mhm. That is why I like substitutes. Like I like talking to you and I like men that I can respect. Doctors, and I keep sort of maybe underneath a feeling like we’re real close, you know, and it’s sort of like a substitute father.',\n",
    " ' Well, you are not really my father .',\n",
    " \" Well, see, I sort of feel that's pretending too, because I can't expect you to feel very close to me. You don't know me that well. \",\n",
    " \" Well, O.K., I'd just like more of it I guess.\",\n",
    " \" Exactly. And I have been so busy trying to get rid of my neurosis. I'd like to have this one neurosis filled. I'd like to just find someone who is going to love me like a father. I even want this in boyfriends. I always want to get an older man that's caring and more mature and not so flip.\",\n",
    " \" That's right. And it seems ironic that since I have been away from my husband, the only type of man I go out with are the kind I don't respect - are the young, flip, not caring, 'smart aleck' kind of guy. Not somebody that's really, you know, that I can respect. That seems like such a big thing.\",\n",

    " ' Well, I think I’m doing very well in many ways, and I need to do some work, And, uh, the most pressing thing with me is that I plan to go to work in the fall,  and have the care of both of my sons.  Without any support other than what I’m earning. And I, and I, I don’t feel very upset about it, but I believe that deep down in my body I’m really afraid. ',\n",
    " ' Well what, what seems most frightening as I think about it is coming home from work very tired ',\n",
    " ' Well, I’m sure I can do it because I, it’s done every day. And, uh, the women I know an… who are trying to do that are having a really hard time. And I’ve been thinking about talking about this problem now with you. I haven’t really… I, I talk about in a heady way with my friends, and, uh, I haven’t given myself any real support  with it. It’s a real fear I have, and it’ll probably be really hard. ',\n",
    " ' Well, the exploring I’ve done is… I decided for myself- well simple, I’ll look for other single working mothers with young children who are doing well. So I started asking, asking my friends, asking some people I know, “Do you know of this kind of person?” Well after about a month, I didn’t come up with one,  one single woman taking care of young children and working full-time who was doing very well and that scared me.',\n",
    " ' Well that substantiates my concern.',\n",
    " ' I’ve had the concern.  I wish, I keep wishing I could find some secrets to make it easier for myself. And the only secrets I can come up with are working half-time  and being really, like, no… food and so forth and so on.  and that may be what I decide to do.',\n",

I think doomed to fail and to be there for my children  in a positive, cheerful, and being a single parent, like I will be  their support system to a large extent.

    " ' Right. And talking about it this way I feel two ways: Like, “Oh c’mon Sylvia. Everybody else is doing it too.” And on the other hand, like, you’re willing to sit here and talk  about it with me and I appreciate that.',\n",
    " ' Right. Well, I do do that, “Buck up, you can do it.” I’ll do that plenty. But I don’t get much opportunity to,  to be sad with somebody about it. ',\n",
    " ' Well, I mean care about me. And it’s not like I’ll have my mother next door, or something like that.',\n",
    " ' It feels sad.  And I get…when I depress myself by thinking, “Well, oh, sure I can give up my children.” And I think, “Well, I won’t do that.” Um, I’m seeing it as a black or white thing  and I know that’s not reality.',\n",
    " ' But then I also feel suspicious of myself. Like, “Well, Sylvia, you’re used to so much of getting your needs met.” Like, going out at night sometimes, um, having friends,  and, and having a social life and not being overtired.

    " ' Yeah about seeing what it will be like. in fact. a little bit there and I think that I was feeling like a relief of tension or, um, I don’t know how to describe it but a relief of, of after crying and feeling sad and then having that feeling pass ',\n",
    " ' Mhm. Yeah. So that’s, that’s what I think about the most, in terms of a problem area. Like, the way I started crying it seemed like I just\\ncouldn’t wait to get here and cry about it. It was a little dramatic that way.',\n",
    " ' Right, I don’t do that  I am busy being strong the problem.',\n",
    " ' And I also think that part of my fear and excitement is that I’ll be doing something different. Like, I’ve never worked  in, in my profession and been like a confident,  single woman with young children  And it’s like, um, that’s what I want for myself. ',\n",
    " ' Well, my youngest son wants me to go work  so that we can have more money and so that he can have more spending money.

I’m hoping  that we can do work with a third party or in a, uh, family group of some sort  because I believe that we’ll\\nneed help.  And, uh, so that’s, that, that part of the fall or the coming year scares me too about feeling so alienated from Senate.',\n",

    " ' Mhm. Yeah, and be happy and... That’s an important… I hadn’t thought of that on my own, but you mentioning my children  brings up the part about Senate, which is a very important part of what I think about.

    " '  Yes, I can. Well, I think the best thing that I like to think about you is that as I understand your writings, I have not read very much that you’ve written, but that you have, that you live what you write about. And my understanding of a lot of popular writers are they write one thing and somehow they just don’t quite live that. They live something very different. And so I think of you as, wonderful in that way and not, uh…',\n",
    " ' Well that it’s what I would like to be more to have values and be able to, to do it and to live them.',\n",

    " ' It certainly does, that’s right.',\n",
    " ' And I like that. I would like to be more present  and, and comfortable with myself so that other people, including my children and so forth and so on, could do what they do, and that I could be able to be a source of support and not be personally threatened by this little thing and that little thing.',\n",
    " ' Mhm. And I’ve enjoyed through the year in the few letters that I’ve gotten from you, your warmth, and interest in me, in my life. I’ve liked that a lot from you.

    " ' Well, I’d like to go one of two ways. I don’t know which yet. Uh, one way would be back to the single working mother business. I’m not sure\\nwhere we might go with that, but I know it’s a big thing for me. And another way would be to go with the difficulty I see myself in having with my relationships with men. that I, I feel like throwing up my hands. “What’s the use of even talking about it?” But I…',\n",
    " ' Yeah. I’ll, I’ll go with the men.  And that’s the most frightening thing for me to talk about  on this film because people that I know will\\nprobably be seeing this  I see myself, uh, and this, this is real scattered in my mind. Scattered,  and looking every which way.  Well, I see myself making acquaintance with men, many men, I mean not just one man  and spending some time with that person. And then, um, feeling that they lost interest in me or that I turned them off. And I tell myself things like, “You can’t expect every man you meet to fall in love with you.”  what else? Oh and then I’ll tell myself all these reasonable… “Of course this man doesn’t like me because I’m this and I’m that and.…” But, I don’t very\\noften feel the disappointment and confusion about “Well I had a good time with that man.” And it seems to me like he must not have had a good time with me because I didn’t hear from him again, or I did and things went such and such a way. And, uh…',\n",
    " ' Uh-huh. And then I have feedback from one person, one man friend of mine, who says that I create, ya know I turn people off, men, myself. And so it’s like it’s all, it’s all my doing anyway.  But I have felt lately impotent about how to, how to have a successful long rel- long lasting relationship with a man. Successful, I don’t mean perfect, I mean  workable. And, uh, I think workable is successful ',\n",
    " ' Now I’m remembering we talked about this before.',\n",
    " ' A little bit, right. And I do that, the kind of analyzing that ‘”Well I have all these habits like, uh, I, um, I like to be by myself, I’m not\\nreal generous and outgoing  and taking care of, of people that I meet.” And the woman that I live with says that she doesn’t see me doing that at all like, “Oh come in I’ll fix you dinner, I’ll do this, I’ll do that.” Like I don’t do that. And, and so I’m confused about do I need to do that to be in a close relationship? It doesn’t seem to me like I should  need to sell out to be enjoyed and wanted.',\n",
    " ' Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he’ll want me.',\n",
    " ' Or wanting to do it.  And then I… another question, hard question, I ask myself is, “Well, I’m choosing men to relate to that don’t know\\nhow to give in the way that I want to be given to.”  And then I try to figure that one out.  “Oh simple, I’m choosing, that just means I need to choose differently.”  And then I look around and it doesn’t seem so simple.',\n",

And I left him for a man I was very much in love with that I’ve been very close to  for five years. But he’s also… like, I moved away from him but I felt left by him also. And so this man friend of mine said to me, “Well, what’s wrong with you that you can’t keep a man?” And that, uh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical, sensible way that doesn’t seem like reality.

    " \" Oh, yeah. But I proceeded very meticulously to carry out a plan, where my children would live in an area that I wanted them to live. And that, I was trying to control something after I died. Only when I went back this year in March to celebrate my children's birthday, and I had four weeks, incidentally, to live at that time; I was told on March 15 that I had four weeks to live. And it was really incredible because like, for the first time, I saw all my relatives and my friends. And they were coming in and they were very loving, very loving people, and very kind, you see. Um, but\\nat the same time, they were all throwing flowers on my grave. And I don't think they knew that. And as a result, I got worse and I got worse, and\\num, I took a friend back. You see, I'd lived out here in California. um, after I found out that I had leukemia, I proceeded to develop a plan to move my family out here. And we moved out in approximately November after several trips out in the area. The trips were basically to find a doctor  and also find in a way some kind of a hope. You see,  I have this conditioned thing about being a fighter. So, on one hand I accept that, and on the other hand I was trying to do all I damned well could to live.\",\n",
    " \" No. Not at all. You know, the thing that uh, you know, after I was sitting in there and I was thinking . . . I had really conditioned myself to, to really get ready and find the nearest cross and crawl up on that, and I've been doing that since I was seven years old, and I'm not sure why.\",\n",
    " \" Oh, I'm not really sure. But I think the activities I was involved in, in terms of trans-racial communication,  working with groups, and helping people  I would hope very similar to what people like yourself did. Um, always being available for everybody, all the time. I think that's being a martyr or  something. Yeah.\",\n",
    " ' For sure. Yeah. Instead of saying, \"Hey, there\\'s some time for me.\" Because you see, I worked so hard and so long that it was just really, really difficult for me to get used to, you know, being sick, not working\\' and not being in control because I definitely was not in control.  And there were a lot of things that I did that I am not really very pleased about.  But you know, after thinking about it for just a little while, or whatever, one of the things I miss you know, I guess maybe from not telling people or whatever, about I was ill ... but uh, after I told them, some months later, when I had four weeks to live, I didn’t find anybody that allowed me to be desperate, that could understand some of the things that I didn\\'t want to do.  And that brought on another guilt trip.  And so now I\\'m in the process of kind of washing all that stuff out.',\n",
    " \" I've lost my father-in-law, which was a terrible loss to me, and it was a loss that I never could talk to my wife or anybody else about.  And I gave a lot to that family, you know, for five or, I don't know, seven years I guess. And when I went back, there were just some things that happened that they showed me there wasn't, there wasn't very much of a connection. There wasn't very much of a connection between, between all of that love and whatever that I put in, and then all of a sudden you know, I became just another uh, you know, I became just another black person. I became just another nigger. You know, and I think it's important to understand that my wife is you know, is white, German Irish. And I think that's a part of that whole thing. Um, when we first married, you know, my father-in-law, we just fought tooth and nail, but then after that we loved each other . . . for about six long, good, hard years. And basically, he was my only connection and when he died . . . I found that there was no support.  There was absolutely no support.\",\n",
    " ' Right. For sure. Yeah, I think that, you know, what I wanted, what I wanted more than anything else, was just to you know, I guess, was love. I guess it was that mutualness, you know, what I felt for each of them.  You know, I thought that was not only my responsibility, but you know, it was very natural for me to care about people  that were very close to my wife at that time.',\n",
    " \" Oh yeah. For sure it did. And there were various things that happened in terms of things that were happening back east . . . that people were wondering why I had left, you know, a good position and all that kind of garbage. And uh, because, see, I hadn't told anybody that I had leukemia.  And uh, one thing led to another. And there were stories that needed, I think to um, I think every story, every situation needs to have two sides.  And there was only one side and I was, I was hurt because I didn't have my chance.\",\n",
    " \" Never. And, but at the same time, like, in a way, in a way, I used to feel that I put myself in that position. Because no one knew what was happening inside of me, you see. Because I had to take care of myself. And I had to be better than everybody else. Because I was always told that. You can, in a majority society I had to be 100, 200 percent better than my white counterpart  or my brown counterpart,  or whatever. I had to do that, because that's what it took to survive .\",\n",
    " ' Oh, no. Not at - I really, I really had a fear of that. You know?  I really, I guess, didn\\'t trust some things that were happening,  um,\\ngee, at a whole global level, you know. But to, then to entrust that kind of information  I was very uneasy about that.  And I did a lot of things that I didn\\'t, didn\\'t really want to do  because I was very desperate. Um, I gave up my, my job and came out here, and I did consultant work and so forth, but I had to use a great deal of money for diagnosticians or whatever and, and, and all kinds of little gimmicks to keep me alive. And consequently I had to borrow money. And when I borrowed that money, I didn\\'t borrow it in a way that would say to you like, \"Hey, uh, Ted or whatever, I need, you know X amount of dollars, you know, and like . . . \\'cause I\\'ve got, I have leukemia,\" and so forth. I\\'m scared to death to say that, you know? You know, I needed some money because of uh, I think I must have invented about ten stories, you know. And I think about it and you know, like, I felt real bad about that, you know.  And uh, because like I had developed a professional uh, attitude I think, about myself, or at least a kind of . . . I had a lot of respect from a lot of people.  And you know, I really did have that . . . I don’t know if that was love or caring or whatever, but it was respect.  When I got involved with money, the situation with money, I had to borrow money and I really couldn\\'t tell. And in a way, you know, I really wanted to tell, but I hadn\\'t even told my wife And I said, okay, well one thing, you know, and I\\'m gonna, I\\'m going to be okay, and this money is going to be here, and everything else like that and I think that\\'s a part of, uh, me that I really, I\\'m not really sure, that ah, you know, is reallyacceptable you know, because I have to be perfect.',\n",
    " ' Oh yeah. For sure. Very true. I . . . That was very difficult. The most difficult part, I think, of  I think it was the most difficult part of my illness. It was that, \"Hey, I  couldn\\'t have cancer,\" you know. That\\'s like having V.D. and three kinds of V.D. at the same time.  You know, how do you tell someone, \"I have leukemia . . . I have less than a year to live, or whatever  . . . and I need some money.\"  You know, it\\'s like when people you know, look at a\\ndrinking glass or whatever, and you know, after you told them you have cancer . . . and they make kind of a . . . shy away from your drinking glasses.',\n",
    " ' I really don\\'t know. I really, you know, I\\'ve really tried to debate this thing in myself for a long time, and I really, I really don\\'t know how I could have done anything any other way, because, you see, it was my character  to not, I never . . . I\\'m always there to help other people.  I wasn\\'t there for . . . to say, \"Hey, you know, I need some nourishment right now, whatever, you know.\"',\n",
    " \" Absolutely. Even when I needed money or whatever, I didn't need money because of my health.  It was because of maybe bad business experience or an investment, or something or other . . . and like, for the people who trusted that kind of information or whatever . . . like I, you know, well, I'm going to deal with that. I'm going to deal with that. But that's not in my character, it's never been in my character.  I had to keep that\\nimage.  And uh, it cost me my family, a couple children, you know. I guess that was the most important thing that it cost me. I think the other things are really not that important. But, but what it did do, what the leukemia did do . . . it helped me to, to understand that I'm just an ordinary human being like everybody else. You know, and sometimes you know, like, everybody has problems, and so forth, but at the same time it was like, it was my character to do that. You know, I wouldn't tell them. No. For what?\",\n",
    " ' I think, I think it did. I think it did. Finally, at the end it did. I use the end . . . the four weeks when I was told I had four weeks to live that was the end, at the end of the leukemia. Even though I\\'m in remission now, I don\\'t plan to, I don\\'t . . . you see, I haven\\'t told you that I went to, I went for the tests and gave enormous amounts of blood. I don\\'t know where they were sending that blood or what they were doing with it. I gave an extraordinary amount, but nothing, nothing was coming of that. But you know, one of the things I did know that if I went to the hospital, if I did what the doctors said, I\\'d probably die. And it\\'s almost like, you know, when you first become an agnostic in school, or whatever, you know, you go through . . . like I went through all this religious training, whatever. . . and I said, \"I don\\'t think that there\\'s a God.\" Or, \"that isn\\'t really important, or whatever.\"  But then at the same time, I hold back, you know. And every now and then I give an occasional prayer just in case.',\n",
    " \" For sure. I think that's what I was also doing in terms of the leukemia. I really did. I had . . . the logical end to leukemia that my uncle and cousin had had before me was to die.  Was to die. And now I think I know some things about that, though, that you don't have to die. Because it wasn't until I saw everybody throwing leaves and things on my grave that I really understood that I had the power to do that, and that, by lying for money, was probably worse for me than . . . than the leukemia, I think.  I don’t know if that makes any sense . . .\",\n",

They don't have to carry that burden of trying to change and always being the recipient of certain policies and things like that and always being controlled.  And I never really, it made me feel apart . . . because I don't know if my second grade teacher thought they were doing me a favor by telling me I was a credit to my race, but then . . . they certainly did, and I didn't feel goodabout it then. And I remember talking to a person when I came down. I'd just discovered I was in remission, and I was hobbling on a cane, and so forth, and God, the first thing I did down here was to take a motorcycle ride. Now, for me, that was radical. For me, that was extremely radical, but it was fun  you know, and it was one of the first fun things that I did.  Since I was ill, you know, because on top of having the leukemia I was fighting a divorce and having my property ripped away from me, you know, and having married into a family, and a family that was a different race than I was, and I learned later, as my wife told me that she didn't know that a whole community wanted to divorce. Like they were married. And I was hurt by that too.You know, how very good,  Christian, upstanding people  can make some pretty serious judgments without knowing you know, the whole story.\",\n",

I forgot for maybe a couple of years - Now, I'm going to oversimplify this next thing  . . . but I forgot that I was black,  in that family, in that community,  And then I quickly learned that I . . .\",\n",

It was just, you know, hey it was so bad, it got so bad . . . this whole trip of leukemia . . . and lying and things like that or whatever, that I don\\'t know. I thought, \"Well, if I can just get ahead a little bit, and make enough money to pay off all those people or whatever, or, and even in my will and with my insurance\" You know, I made sure that all of the people were going to be paid or whatever  but, you know. I still wasn\\'t, it still wasn\\'t acceptable to me for some reason . . .

You know, I have some feelings about that . . . you know, personal, religious, whatever. But I think a great part of that had something to do with deciding that I wanted to live.\",\n",
    " \" Yeah. It's really good to hear you say that. Because I really feel that. Because what I did I think was . . . My phone bill had to be about $1,500 a month you know, because I was so worried about the children, you know.\",\n",

It happened yeah . . . it happened the other day. She called and everything was really great and then she\\'d begin to talk  about a lot of other people, and what their attitudes and what their opinions was.

I remember I got a phone call. And I was staying at my wife\\'s house where we were going, keep in mind now, we were going through a divorce, the whole bit, and were, uh celebrating my children\\'s birthday at the same time. My mother calls. \"We\\'re coming over.\" Nobody at the house. All of a sudden I lose my . . . my vision goes.  You know, that was one of the symptoms  of leukemia. And uh, and, it scare-, it scared the hell out of me  like I really wanted to run. But I couldn\\'t run, I couldn\\'t see.  And um, it was only when I got back to California that I tried to put that together, you know  of what happened when in terms of you know, the paralysis that I had in terms of my legs. It\\'s incredible, it really seemed like somehow, somehow I\\'ve got control of that, in some way but I mean I\\'m not really sure. But I\\'m convinced that I have control. But I\\'m not sure how.

I\\'m doing okay.\" \"To be on the safe side.\" You know?  That\\'s . . . well, I won\\'t say what that is.

I\\'m certainly not trying to indict all doctors or the medical profession  by what happened to me, you know, I think, I hope, in some way that other people who have life-threatening illnesses can deal with it because I think I have, and I do have that control. And like, since I was 7, to some extent, when I went down in that basement and turned that light off, or whatever, and I shut the outside world off . . . or whatever, somehow I\\'ve lost that . . . because somehow in the process of becoming educated and socialized, and whatever,  I let other people control what I wanted and what I wanted to do.

They were important times in terms of when I was alone, and when I was sure, and when I felt good and I felt a part of the you know, the stars, the universe. I really did feel that. You know, I remember I used to go out when I was 7, 8, 9 years old . . . three or four o\\'clock in the morning, look up in\\nthat beautiful sky and see those stars and I\\'d say, \"That\\'s mine over there and I\\'m going to be there.\" And I felt good.
